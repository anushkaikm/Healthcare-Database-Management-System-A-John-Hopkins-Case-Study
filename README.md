# Healthcare-Database-Management-System-A-John-Hopkins-Case-Study

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced healthcare environment, efficient management of hospitals and pharmacy operations is critical to ensuring high-quality patient care and services. The Johns Hopkins Hospital, a non-profit academic medical center in Baltimore, Maryland, sets healthcare standards in patient care, research, and education. We decided to work with Johns Hopkins Hospital due to its prominence in the healthcare industry and the complexity of pharmacy operations within such a renowned academic medical center.

Our area of focus is on patient care and pharmacy operations. In Patient Care, we have entities including Patients, Medical Records, Departments, Employees, Physicians, Nurses, Billing & Insurance. Meanwhile, the Pharmacy Operations within the hospital will encompass a wide range of functions, including Medicine, Prescriptions, Inventory, and Transactions. The database and data we created centers around optimizing patient care and pharmacy operations, enhancing patient satisfaction, and ensuring regulatory compliance within Johns Hopkins Hospital.

## Objective

This project's objective is to design and implement a comprehensive database management system that streamlines patient care and pharmacy operations. The database will facilitate efficient management of patients, medical records, billing, insurance, pharmacy transactions, and more. By working on a Healthcare Management System project, we can gain exposure to a critical practical, real-world application. Additionally, working with pharmacies provides us access to diverse pharmacy workflows, patient populations, and clinical settings, allowing us to design a comprehensive and realistic database solution. Moreover, the project will involve creating a set of SQL queries to build tables, load data, and perform essential data retrieval tasks, thereby providing a practical and scalable solution to the hospital's data management needs.

## Entities

The database includes the following entities:

- **Patients**: Information about patients, including personal details and medical history.
- **Medical Records**: Detailed records of patient diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes.
- **Departments**: Various hospital departments and their details.
- **Employees**: Information about hospital staff, including physicians, nurses, and administrative personnel.
- **Physicians & Nurses**: Specific details about medical professionals, including specialties and schedules.
- **Billing & Insurance**: Information related to patient billing and insurance claims.
- **Medicine**: Details about medications available in the hospital.
- **Prescriptions**: Records of prescriptions issued to patients.
- **Inventory**: Management of medication and medical supplies inventory.
- **Transactions**: Financial transactions related to pharmacy operations and patient billing.

## EER Diagram

The Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram visualizes the entities, attributes, and relationships in the database. It provides a clear representation of how different entities are connected and organized within the system.

## 3NF Relational Model

The Third Normal Form (3NF) relational model ensures that the database is structured to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves organizing data into tables with each table focusing on a specific entity or relationship, adhering to normalization principles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the project, you will need the following:
- SQL Server or any other relational database management system
- SQL client tool (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL Workbench)

### Running the Project

1. Open your SQL client tool and connect to your database server.
2. Run the SQL scripts provided in the `scripts/` directory to create the database schema and populate the tables with sample data.
3. Use the provided SQL queries to perform data retrieval and management tasks.

## Results

The results of the project will be documented in the SQL scripts and any accompanying reports or analysis files.
